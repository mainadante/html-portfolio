<h3>Pride And Prejudice</h3>
<p>This is my favorite romantic movie. I love the scenary and the love story between Lizzie and Mr. Fitzwilliam.</p>

<h3>Flipped</h3>
<p>Flipped is also a romantic movie and it tell the story of two kids and how they see things differently even though passing through same situation. I also like the whole picture theory.</p>
