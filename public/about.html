<p>I am Mainã Dante.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Brazil, nevertheless I like saying I live everywhere, because I love traveling and living in different places.</p>

<p>I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ and I love that. Everything that I do in my life is based on the principles I've learned in church. I love going to church on Sundays and being around friends I make there.</p>
    
<p> I have a Fashion Degree from Feevale University, Brazil; an MBA in Business Management from LaSalle University, Brazil and a Web Developer certificate from Cumorah Academy, Czech Republic.</p>

<p>I love sports although I'm not good at them whatsoever. I love cycling in the city, feeling the fresh air against my face and the excitment of cycling with the traffic. I also love water sports, the nature, being outdoors and I'm always ready for a new advanture!</p>
    
<p>I work as an Web Developer and I'm here to help you with your website!</p>
